 Amazon Echo-enabled Pizza Ordering System
The project takes input from ( https://echosim.io/ )




The input is in form of voice instructions from the user. And also involves responding to the questions asked by app in audio form. This conversation is the front end of placing an order for a customer.


Google Spread Sheet API has been used for :
Storing and retrieving the pizza shop menu details like the pizza type available, size and price of the chosen pizza 
Storing and retrieving details if customer wants to order a custom pizza
To save customer orders and their details like name, contact number and address in case of delivery. 
To store order type: pickup or delivery


AWS Lambda Function has been written to map the utterances(what user will speak while ordering) with intents (to process utterances our service can accept)
