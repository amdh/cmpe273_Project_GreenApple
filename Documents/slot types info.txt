AMAZON.DURATION
Converts words that indicate durations into a numeric duration.
The duration is provided to your skill in a format based on the ISO-8601 duration format (PnYnMnDTnHnMnS). The P indicates that this is a duration. The n is the numeric value, and the capital letter following the n designates the specific date or time element. For example, P3D means 3 days. A T is used to indicate that the remaining values represent time elements rather than date elements.
